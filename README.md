## Data Sources
1. **Internal Data**:
   - **Sales**: Transaction_ID, Store_ID, Product_ID, Date, Quantity, Price.
   - **Customers**: Customer_ID, Age, Gender, Location, Join_Date.
   - **Stores**: Store_ID, Location, Size, Category.
2. **External Data**:
   - Holiday calendar (sourced from Kaggle, e.g., U.S. Holidays 2004–2021).
   - Weather data (optional via API or public datasets).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sales trends: Time series analysis of sales across stores and categories.
- Customer segmentation:
  - High spenders, frequent buyers, and low-engagement groups.
- Product and store performance: Identified top and low-performing categories and stores.
- Correlations between external factors (e.g., holidays, weather) and sales.
